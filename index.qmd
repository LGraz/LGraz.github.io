## Statistical Consulting

I have consulted over 200 clients, including mostly PhD and master's students as well as professionals from the industry. Discussing these cases in the Statistics Seminar at ETH Zurich has given me a good overview of various methods and the necessary mathematical understanding. Now, it is becoming rare that I cannot deliver a solution.

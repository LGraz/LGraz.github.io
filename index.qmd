## Statistical Consulting

Regular discussions of these cases in the Seminar for Statistics at ETH Zurich have broadened my understanding of the statistical landscape and deepened my mathematical insights. This comprehensive experience means I can deliver effective solutions for most statistical challenges. [Learn more about my services](statistical-consulting.qmd).

## Statistical Consulting
I have consulted over 200 clients, primarily PhD and master's students along with industry professionals. Regular discussions of these cases in the Seminar for Statistics at ETH Zurich have broadened my understanding of the statistical landscape and deepened my mathematical insights. This comprehensive experience means I can deliver effective solutions for most statistical challenges I encounter.
